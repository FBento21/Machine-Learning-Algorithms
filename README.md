# ML Algorithms from scratch

This repo contains a set of classic machine learning algorithms that I wrote from scratch for fun and learning purposes.

For now, I implemented these algorithms in Python, using only Numpy and Pandas. Scikit-learn and similar libraries might be used only for testing purposes, never in the algorithms (of course :)). Matplotlib and other visualization libraries might be used for graphical purposes.

I will try to include the sources for these algorithms.

## Roadmap

I will most likely focus on decision tree algorithms as I find them quite interesting to implement.

The only implemented algorithm is the ID3 algorithm for a categorical target and categorical features. Hopefully, I will able to share more stuff soon, like

- ID3 for both categorical and regression problems
- CART
- Random Forest
- Some form of Gradient Boosting
- etc

## Constraints

Besides the constraint of only using "basic" numerical computation libraries, it's **NOT** allowed to use LLMs or similar tools to write the algorithms. If needed, it's allowed to ask for very small snippets of code (for example, how to do X thing in pandas) and to write/format docstrings, never to write complete sections of the algorithms. Besides that, this code must stray free of AI, only the raw man-made code is permitted ;)!

Since this code is written for learning/educational/recreative purposes, I will try to keep it as understandable as possible. Readability is more important than performance. If you would like to improve some of the algorithms, just open an Issue!
